# Project Proposal

## Project title

College Money Tracker

## What and why?

The software would be a money and expenses tracker for college students. When I came to university, I found it really hard to manage my money wisely, and all the applications that I found were not good for me. This software would be completely adaptable for students, giving tips on how to save money, tracking where their biggest expenses are, providing assistance for budgeting according to their region, and even helping to plan to pay their student loans.

## For whom?

This software would be focused on college students and recent grads as end-users.

## How?

After creating an account, the user would have the option to connect to their bank account (which would make the money tracking more efficient), or choose to add expenses manually. The user would also have to answer a few questions that would determine how the account would be set up, such as:

- How frequent the source of income: weekly, biweekly, irregular

  - Knowing this would also be helpful for the budgeting

- What are the categories they will be budgeting for? (e.g. groceries, take out, bills, etc)

- Adding reccuring payments, and keeping track of how much of their paycheck is going to subscription services

After that, the user would be able to budget for the categories they selected, and the app would keep track of how much they spent for the budgetting period. For the next budgetting cycle, the user would see the previous amount they budgetted for and how much they spent.

## Scope

The software would consist of a few pages that allows the user to add their information and makes calculations about their finances. The pages would have to be user friendly and simple enough for people who do not have familiarity with dealing with finances, but should also be a software that is able to store the data and make the appropriate calculations and estimates for the user.
